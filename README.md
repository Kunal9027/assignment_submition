# B2B Events Data Scraping Project

## Introduction
This project involved scraping data from top B2B event websites using Python scripting with BeautifulSoup and Helium libraries. The objective was to gather comprehensive information about upcoming business networking events for analysis and decision-making.

## Summary of Data Collected
- **Events Scraped**: 5 events from various B2B event websites.
- **Data Fields Collected**:
  - Event Name
  - Date & Time
  - Location
  - Description
  - Pricing
  - Tags
  - Organizer
  - Agenda/Schedule
  - Registration Details (URL)

## Key Insights or Findings
- **Pricing**: Handling dynamic content with Helium was crucial for extracting pricing information due to JavaScript rendering.
- **Event Tags**: Common tags such as "Networking", "Startups", and "Business" highlight the thematic focus of the events.
- **Organizers**: Events were hosted by diverse entities, ranging from local startup networks to global event platforms like Eventbrite.

## Data Integrity and Quality
- **Completeness**: Most events provided comprehensive information, though dynamic content posed challenges for some fields like Pricing.
- **Challenges**: Addressing dynamic content and occasional changes in website structure required iterative testing and adjustments.

## Future Considerations
- **Enhancements**: Implementing automated data validation checks to ensure data consistency and completeness.
- **Additional Data**: Potential additions include attendee demographics, speaker bios, or session details for deeper analysis and insights.
